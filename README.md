> **A hands-on journey into data pipelines, warehouses, and analytics foundations.**

This is my personal data engineering portfolio, focused on building,
transforming, and maintaining data systems using real-world tools and patterns.

I come from a strong SQL and systems background, with hands-on experience
supporting enterprise healthcare systems and databases. This portfolio
documents my transition deeper into data engineering through practical,
well-documented projects.

This project will focus on:
- Fact and dimension table design
- Transforming raw data into analytics-ready structures
- Writing business-focused analytical queries

### 🔄 ETL Pipelines
Building ETL pipelines to ingest, transform, and load data using Python and SQL.
Planned areas of focus include:
- Data ingestion from flat files and APIs
- Transformations and data validation
- Clear, maintainable pipeline structure

### ⚙️ Databricks & Spark Learning
Hands-on learning with Spark and PySpark using Databricks.
This project will explore:
- Distributed data processing concepts
- Data transformations at scale
- Understanding how Spark fits into modern data platforms

### 📊 Analytics Foundations
Exploring how engineered data supports analytics and reporting.
This project will focus on:
- Preparing data for analysis
- Writing analytical queries
- Understanding downstream analytics needs

## 🌱 Current Focus

My current focus is strengthening my SQL foundations and learning how SQL is
used in deeper data engineering scenarios. This includes writing more complex
queries to transform, join, and prepare data for analytics and downstream use.

Alongside SQL, I am beginning to incorporate Python and PySpark to understand
how these tools complement SQL in data pipelines, transformations, and
large-scale data processing.
